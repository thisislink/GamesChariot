# GamesChariot
Scraper built to a get list of games from the Netflix [website](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/121442).

## Purpose
Here are some reasons I developed this project:

* I like video games.
* I find Netflix's gaming division interesting.
* Netflix does not have an API (that I could find) for their games.
* I had interest in a Netflix role tweeted out on Twitter in January 2022, but it required Java experience. [The article I wrote and the tweet that started it all](https://alwayslearningtech.com/java-practice).
* I completed a Summer 2022 Upper Division Advanced Java college course in July 2022 to help strengthen my graduate school application and earned a 4.0. The group project was to design a web application and we developed an Issue Tracker. Most of [my private GitHub contributions](https://github.com/thisislink) in July were to the Issue Tracker. This was my first Java project in a group. 
* Most of my corporate professional coding experience is in .NET (VB and C#), so the only way to learn and practice Java is outside of work.
* The Java class taught me the fundamentals of setting up a Tomcat server and using HTTP Servlets instead of using a framework. I wanted to learn how to use Spring Boot to make server setup easier and quicker.
* The Issue Tracker project exposed secret credentials publically that I normally would not have wanted pushed to GitHub. There is a concept of env files and environment variables in C# and Node. I figured there had to be a similar concept in Java. So, I wanted to learn how to keep sensitive information secure in a Java application and off GitHub.
